# landroidworxapp
Hi to everyone!

I've a Landroid M500 and like many of us, i have noticed that the official app does not allow to set more than one work schedule per day. This is very frustrating if our garden is suddivided in more than one zone. 
So, during last month i've developed a web app in which is possible to set work schedule more than one in a day.
I want to thank @Eisha because i've taken ispiration from the code of his Desktop App.

So, pratically the web app has the main functionalities like the official app, is intuitive, very simple to understand the usage and grafically clean.
